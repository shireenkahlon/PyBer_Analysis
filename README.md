# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this project is to examine the data from a ridesharing company, PyBer, and how their sales relate to the three different city types — rural, suburban, and urban cities; the data examined will be from 2019 specifically. The project will examine how the city types relate to the number of rides, the fare amount in dollars, and the drivers. Included in this report is a detailed visualization of the fare amounts (in U.S. dollars) per month in the different city types. This report will be handed to V. Isualize in order for PyBer to make decisions on which cities (based on city type) should receive extra resources from the company compared to which are thriving without help.
## Results
After reviewing the overall summary of the data taken in 2019 from the three city types, we can determine that while urban cities had the most rides, drivers, and fares, the suburban and specifically the rural cities had higher average fare per ride and average fare per driver. This could possibly be due to an increase of individual fare money per ride to make up for the lack of rides and drivers. The image attached below portrays the summary  of the three city types.

	To delve deeper into the differences, I’ve created a weekly summary between January and April comparing the fares between the three city types. Attached below is a line graph showing the results of this weekly analysis.  From this visualization, we can gather that while rural areas have spikes — specifically in the first week of April where rural hits its high of $501 — rural areas do not nearly meet the same amounts of money received as suburban and especially urban areas do. Suburban areas have a couple of spikes and drops but generally stays in the same range of fare amounts, while urban reaches as much as $2466 in a week and as low as $1661 in another.

Further analysis would need to be done to determine other questions that stem from the above visualization. For one, we would need to examine why there is a spike in the third week of February across rural, urban, and suburban cities — possibilities for this could be a festival or popular event that took place. To determine the circumstances surrounding the February spike, I would need to look back at 2018 data to see if that same spike occurred during this timeframe as well. Other questions that came up are how many people were generally in a PyBer. For example, if more people in rural areas requested a large car for a large party, this would increase the fare for the ride thus showing an increase of average fare but would not increase the amount of fares received. Another question would be to ask the length of the trip as that could also increase fare money. The answers we do currently have can assist us in answering many questions to guide PyBer on decisions to make, however more analysis would be needed for further recommendations.
## Summary:
From the data available to me and the analysis created, I can safely make a few recommendations to V. Isualize. Firstly, to help rural and suburban area drivers make a living wage, more assistance or additional payments to the drivers may be necessary. Secondly, the average fare per driver in urban areas is $16.57, whereas the average fare in suburban areas is $29.50. While more analysis would need to be conducted on the reasons why this is, one reason possibly could be the competitiveness considering there are approximately 39,854 drivers in urban areas compared to 19,356 drivers in suburban areas. My recommendation would be to encourage - through monetary bonus or advertisements - urban drivers to drive in suburban areas as well to increase rides, drivers, and fare money. Lastly, I would recommend to increase resources to rural areas. In the week of January 13th, 2019, only $67.65 in fares were received. More resources – possibly an office from PyBer, having a representative visit rural areas, or making changes to the app which may benefit rural areas – may be critical to raising money in such locations.
